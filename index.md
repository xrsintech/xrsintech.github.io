# About me

My name is Xander Rosado-Sessa. I'm passionate about the IT/Cybersecurity industry and continuously expanding my knowledge base and skills as a professional in this field. I graduated from Western Governor's University with a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, and I plan to continue my education with a Master's degree. The certifications I hold include CompTIA ITF+, A+, Network+, Security+, Server+, CySA+, Linux+, PenTest+, Cloud Essentials+, Cloud+, CASP/SecurityX, Project+, Cisco CCNA, ETA ITS, ITIL 4 Foundation, and Associate of ISC2. 

Above all else, I practice my skills by performing hands on activies. Experience varies for everyone, but it is undoubtedly extremely important to practice the information you learn in this field, not relying only on knowledge and concepts. Likewise, it is very important to have real knowledge on what you do, to know what something truly does at a fundamental level, and to understand why and how it does what it does. I try to bring the best of both worlds, as I believe that's how true mastery of the subject is ascertained. I've went through several years of technical training before pursuing my bachelor's degree, as well as worked in help desk roles and competed nationally for Cybersecurity. Through these opportunities, I've been able to learn and share the skills I present on this page.
